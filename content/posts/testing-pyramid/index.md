On the Relevance of the Classical Testing Pyramid
<!--more-->
---
In [the second part](unit-test-ambiguity) I stress the importance of focussing on testing actual requirements, behavior,
use-cases not implementation details like methods and classes.
Through shedding a new light on the classical testing pyrmaid,
this article will show that there are exceptions to this and at times it is necessary to test implementation details.

## Classical Pyramid

The idea is that your test suite consists out of 
- a lot of Unit Tests
- fewer Integration Tests
- as little as possible End To End tests
